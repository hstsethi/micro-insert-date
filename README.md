Micro editor plugin to insert current date in ISO861 format.


I wrote this back then in 2020, aged 16. Now it's 2025, I see there still isn't any plugin to insert date, so I have decided to publish it.
Though I no longer use Micro editor. Hence this plugin is no longer maintained, though it does work at time of uploading.

A similar plugin for Nvim is available in my [No Frills Dotfiles](https://github.com/hstsethi/no-frills-dotfiles) project.
